= EUS-to-EUS update using the CLI

.Prerequisites

* Verify that machine config pools are unpaused.
* Update the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to the target version before each update.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is highly discouraged to skip this prerequisite. If the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is not updated to the target version before your update, unexpected issues may occur.
====

.Procedure

. Using the Administrator perspective on the web console, update any Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators to the versions that are compatible with the version you are updating to. You can find more information on how to perform this action in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

. Verify that all machine config pools display a status of `UPDATED` and that no machine config pool displays a status of `UPDATING`.
To view the status of all machine config pools, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     CONFIG                                         	UPDATED   UPDATING
master   rendered-master-ecbb9582781c1091e1c9f19d50cf836c       True  	  False
worker   rendered-worker-00a3f0c68ae94e747193156b491553d5       True  	  False
----

. Change to the `eus-4.12` channel by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade channel eus-4.12
----
+
[NOTE]
====

If you receive an error message indicating that `eus-4.12` is not one of the
available channels, this indicates that Red Hat is still rolling out 4.10 to 4.12 EUS updates.
This rollout process generally takes 45-90 days starting at the GA date.
====
+

. Pause all worker machine pools except for the master pool by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/worker --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"paused":true}}'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot pause the master pool.
====

. Update to the latest version by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --to-latest
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Updating to latest version 4.11.18
----

. Review the cluster version to ensure that the updates are complete by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME  	  VERSION  AVAILABLE  PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.11.18   True       False         6m29s   Cluster version is 4.11.18
----

. Update to version 4.12 by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --to-latest
----

. Retrieve the cluster version to ensure that the 4.12 updates are complete by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME  	  VERSION  AVAILABLE  PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.12.1   True       False         6m29s   Cluster version is 4.12.1
----

. To update your worker nodes to 4.12, unpause all previously paused machine config pools by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/worker --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"paused":false}}'
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If pools are not unpaused, the cluster is not permitted to update to any future minor versions, and maintenance tasks such as certificate rotation are inhibited. This puts the cluster at risk for future degradation.
====

. Verify that your previously paused pools are updated and that the update to version 4.12 is complete by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME 	   CONFIG                                            UPDATED     UPDATING
master   rendered-master-52da4d2760807cb2b96a3402179a9a4c    True  	 False
worker   rendered-worker-4756f60eccae96fb9dcb4c392c69d497    True 	 False
